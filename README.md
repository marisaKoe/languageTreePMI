# languageTreePMI

The program reconstructs the language tree and its bootstrap replicates as described in Köllner (2021). 
The details of the approach are described in Chapter 4.1.4 in the Dissertation.

The program to compute the consensus tree out of the bootstrap replicates is PAUP* (Swofford 2003), which can be found online under: https://paup.phylosolutions.com
