# languageTreePMI

The program reconstructs the language tree and its bootstrap replicates as described in Köllner (2021). 
The details of the approach are described in Chapter 4.1.4 in the Dissertation.

The language tree is reconstructed using the Bayesian Framework of MrBayes from Ronquist et al (2003), which can be found online under: http://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/
